                <h4 class="review-author">linda from delaware</h4>
                <p class="review-body">Size not consistent. Got a medium pack, one is a lot bigger and longer than the other, although both shirts are labeled as m. In photo attached, placed one on top of the other. See the size variance? Around 2!</p>

                <h3 class="review-heading">Too clingy unless you are model thin</h3>
                <h4 class="review-author">tebone buddy</h4>
                <p class="review-body">I'll be returning these as the spandex is not good for anyone who weighs more than 110lbs. Too skinny for my middle aged lumps and bulges. Amazon, why not come out with a line of looser shirts for those of us of a certain age?</p>

                <h3 class="review-heading">Excellent basic shirt</h3>
                <h4 class="review-author">Elizabeth Grover</h4>
                <p class="review-body">These shirts are AWESOME. Super soft comfortable fabric that is thick enough you can wear over light colored bra without it showing. Great length and just tailored enough to not fit as baggy as a dude's shirt. I have been on the hunt for a flattering decent basic t-shirt & I finally found it!</p>

                <h3 class="review-heading">Great Value, Fitted Style</h3>
                <h4 class="review-author">BMG Boston, MA</h4>
                <p class="review-body">These are true to size, but they are fitted. I am wearing a medium in my photos which is my regular size. They are a soft, thick and stretchy fabric. Love the pattern choices. Great value.</p>

                <h3 class="review-heading">Nice but the neck ruined it for me</h3>
                <h4 class="review-author">L Moore</h4>
                <p class="review-body">This shirt is a lot more stretchy than I thought it would be. Not a bad thing just unexpected. It's rather clingy which I don't care for but the biggest deal breaker for me is the neck. Look at the photo. I hadn't even washed it and the neck is just sagging and unflattering. So, while you could dress it up with a jacket and jewelry, the neck line is just a dead giveaway that it's not a great shirt and is going to be returned.</p>

                <h3 class="review-heading">Fit more like a junior teen size</h3>
                <h4 class="review-author">Kimmy</h4>
                <p class="review-body">This shirts are very clinging and tight fitting even if u went a size up I think it would be better but still be the same unfortunately I haven’t worn this shirts at all I’m now gonna use them in the fall for pj shirts I’f I can even do that I think these are more suited for really skinny women with no curves and maybe would relate it to juniors clothes so unfortunately first time in ordering off of Amazon I would not recommend these I was trying to save time I usually get T shirts at New York and CO but they are online only now since the pandemic</p>
